Points
------

1. If a constructor is explicitly declared by using the static modifier, we call that constructor a static constructor whereas the rest of the others are called non-static constructors only. 

2. Constructors are responsible for initializing the fields or variables of a class. Static Fields/Variables are initialized by static constructors and non-static fields/variables are initialized by non-static or instance constructors in C#

3. Static constructors are implicitly called whereas non-static constructors are explicitly called.

4. Static Constructors execute immediately once the execution of a class start and moreover, it is the first block of code to run under a class whereas non-static constructors execute only after creating the instance of the class as well as each and every time the instance of the class is created.

5. Static Constructors are executed only once whereas the non-static constructors are executed 0 or n number of times depending on the number of instances we created for the class.
